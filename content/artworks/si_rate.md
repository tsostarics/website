description: "Probability of scalar implicature calculation for 64 lexical scales. Upright triangles show RFR tunes (high boundary tone) and upside down triangles show falling tunes (low boundary tone). Proportion for each tune determines the amount of fill for a given color. Cyan, magenta, and yellow were used with a darken color blend mode to mimic printer ink. Data taken from my research on RFR and SI. R."
