description: "Probability of a Yes response to questions that probe what I refer to as the 'merely inference.' That is, the response to questions like 'Would you conclude that it is not merely warm?' As with my SI rate piece, 64 lexical scales are shown here. Upright triangles show RFR tunes (high boundary tone) and upside down triangles show falling tunes (low boundary tone). Proportion for each tune determines the amount of fill for a given color. Blue, red, and gray were used with hard light blending. Data taken from my research on RFR and SI. R."
