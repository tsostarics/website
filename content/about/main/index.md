intro: |
  I am an incoming Systems Engineer at McMaster-Carr in Illinois.
  
  I recently received my PhD in Linguistics from Northwestern University. 
  My research focused on data-driven experimental approaches to understanding intonational meaning in American English. 
  I am interested in R package development, inferential statistics, ordinal data analysis, data visualization, and experimental design. 
  In my free time, I enjoy horror movies, graphic design, role playing games, and walking.
  
  I am the author and maintainer for the [`{contrastable}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/contrastable/index.html) R package.
  
  Although I am no longer in academia, I am available by commission for methods consulting. Examples of things I can help with:
  
   - R programming and analysis code review
   - Praat/R scripts for small-scale projects
   - Data visualization and visual asset creation
   - Feedback and assistance with slides and posters for conferences/job talks
   - Teaching/Explaining topics in regression modeling (e.g., ordinal regression, random effects, contrast coding) 
   
  I believe strongly that researchers, and especially students, should be able to understand, carry out, and defend their own analyses.
  To that end, I will not do full analyses of your data *for* you. I am happy to help get you on the right track though.
  Note that I work full time and my availability is mostly on the weekends.
  
  I can be reached at tsostarics [at] gmail.com. Please note that I only go by Thomas.
