  I am a PhD Candidate in Linguistics and a Data Science Fellow at Northwestern University interested in prosody, pragmatics, phonetics, and aphasia. My research focuses on data-driven experimental approaches to understanding intonational meaning in American English. Adjacent to my research, I am interested in R package development, ordinal data analysis, data visualization, and experimental design. Outside of my research, I enjoy horror movies, graphic design, biking, and taking photos of cities. My website uses photos I've taken from around Chicago and Japan.
  
  At Northwestern I am affiliated with the [Prosody & Speech Dynamics Lab](https://www.prosodylab.linguistics.northwestern.edu/).
  
  Before coming to Northwestern, I obtained a BA in Linguistics from the [University of Chicago](https://linguistics.uchicago.edu/), where I also worked with electrophysiological experiments on concessive connectors in the [Language Processing Lab](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/lpl/).
  
  I can be reached at tsostarics [at] u.northwestern.edu. Please note that I only go by Thomas.
