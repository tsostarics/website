Errata/Notes:

 - Pg 141: "Participants listen to 64 critical trials, 36 items from the filler item set, and 72 filler items. Of these fillers, 36 items were adapted
from Husband & Ferreira (2016) [...]" -> Participants listened to 64 critical trials and 72 filler items. Of these filler items, 36 were adapted from Husband & Ferreira (2016) and 36 were from the newly written set of filler dialogues.
 - Pg 148: "discrimination parameter" should read "sigma parameter" (cumulative link models use `disc` but lognormal models use `sigma`, I just wrote discrimination out of habit from my CLM work).
 - Pg 189: "proment" should read "prominent"
 - Pg 189: Citation to Iskarous, Sostarics, and Cole 2025 is defunct; we ended up not actually submitting a proceedings paper to TAI 2025. The slides from that conference are available though. A full paper with that material will eventually be written.
