Poster available as a high-definition PNG file. The original PDF has a lot of geometry from the faceted graphs, and as a result has a tendency to crash PDF viewers.

On the poster, there are flags with numbers. Flags on the left column of the poster (<i class=""fas fa-flag""></i>) denote specific goals/questions. Match the number on these flags with those of the flags on the right side of the poster (<i class=""fas fa-flag fa-flip-horizontal""></i>) for the observations from the data that address each question.
