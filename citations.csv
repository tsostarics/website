Poster available as a high-definition PNG file. The original PDF has a lot of geometry from the faceted graphs, and as a result has a tendency to crash PDF viewers.

On the poster, there are flags with numbers. Flags on the left column of the poster (<i class=""fas fa-flag""></i>) denote specific goals/questions. Match the number on these flags with those of the flags on the right side of the poster (<i class=""fas fa-flag fa-flip-horizontal""></i>) for the observations from the data that address each question.

 - Pg 141: ""Participants listen to 64 critical trials, 36 items from the filler item set, and 72 filler items. Of these fillers, 36 items were adapted
from Husband & Ferreira (2016) [...]"" -> Participants listened to 64 critical trials and 72 filler items. Of these filler items, 36 were adapted from Husband & Ferreira (2016) and 36 were from the newly written set of filler dialogues.
 - Pg 148: ""discrimination parameter"" should read ""sigma parameter"" (cumulative link models use `disc` but lognormal models use `sigma`, I just wrote discrimination out of habit from my CLM work).
 - Pg 189: ""proment"" should read ""prominent""
 - Pg 189: Citation to Iskarous, Sostarics, and Cole 2025 is defunct; we ended up not actually submitting a proceedings paper to TAI 2025. The slides from that conference are available though. A full paper with that material will eventually be written."
